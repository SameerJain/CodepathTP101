Problem #1

Write a function to reverse a singly linked list. The function should take the head of a linked list as input and return the new head of the reversed linked list.

Examples:
Input: head = [1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5]
Output: [5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1]
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
Input: head = None(DONE)(DONE)(DONE)
Output: None done

"""
Problem #2
Write a function to remove all duplicate values from a sorted linked list. After removing duplicates, each element in the list should appear only once.
Examples:
Input: head = [1 -> 1 -> 2]
Output: [1 -> 2]
Input: head = [1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3]
Output: [1 -> 2 -> 3]
Input: head = []
Output: []
