Why is finding the minimum value node in the right subtree important when deleting a node with two children?
It ensures that the tree remains balanced after deletion.
It helps in finding the largest node in the right subtree.
It replaces the deleted node with the smallest value greater than the deleted node, maintaining the BST properties.
It simplifies the deletion process by removing a leaf node.




Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.
Examples:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1





You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.
